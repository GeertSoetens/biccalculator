# Best Inductive Components' Inductive Calculator
### Currently also known as BIC Calculator

The Best Inductive Components calculator is a simple calculator that calculates complex inductive calculations on the go. This app is designed for electrical engineers that could use an easy way of accessing the calculations they need, on their phone.

The app has been designed by me, a web developer without experience in the field of electro engineering. But every step of the development process has been carefully watched and monitored by a veteran electrical engineer, with over 30 years of experience in the field.

There's a Trello board for the app's progress, as well to see what's stil on the app's to-do-list for the future. \
